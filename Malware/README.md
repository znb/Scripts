Malware
=======

Malware related code. Mostly to learn stuff to solve challenges I face
when looking at bad software. 

 * Glastopf - Stuff for [Glastopf](https://github.com/glastopf/glastopf)
 * Kippo - Stuff for [Kippo](https://code.google.com/p/kippo/)
 * VirusTotal - Stuff for [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/en/documentation/public-api/)
 * Web - Stuff for web related malware, usually PHP shells and the like
 * PE - Stuff for Windows related malware
 * Thug - Stuff for [Thug](https://github.com/buffer/thug)
 * Google - Stuff for Google API's

Some of this code will be incomplete. I have the attention span of a gnat.
